To create a non-root (limited) user and allow them to log in, follow these steps on your Ubuntu VPS:

Create a new user (replace username with your chosen name):

Copy
adduser username
adduser luser2
123
You’ll be prompted to set a password and fill in some optional info.

(Optional) Add the user to the sudo group if you want them to have admin rights:

Copy
usermod -aG sudo username
Skip this step if you want the user to have limited permissions only.

Allow the user to log in via SSH:
The user can now log in using SSH:

Copy
ssh username@72.60.197.169
Switch to the new user from root:

Copy
su - username
This user will have limited permissions by default and will not be able to perform administrative tasks unless added to the sudo group. Let me know if you want to restrict them further or set up SSH keys!

add user for remote server

systemctl restart xrdp


connected with remoter with limited user luser but error on sending login information to session manager

Kodee
This error (“error on sending login information to session manager”) when connecting with xRDP usually means there’s a problem with the desktop environment configuration or permissions for the limited user.

Here’s how to fix it:

Set XFCE as the default session for your user:

Log in as the limited user (luser) via SSH and run:

123
/home/luser/Downloads
http://youtube/guKeeZy2FNE
Copy
echo "startxfce4" > ~/.xsession
chmod +x ~/.xsession
Ensure your user owns their home directory:

As root, run:
123
123
Copy
chown -R luser:luser /home/luser
chown -R luser:luser2 /home/luser
Restart the xRDP service:

Copy
sudo systemctl restart xrdp
Try connecting again using your RDP client.

Extra Tips:

Make sure you log out of any active desktop sessions for luser before starting a new one.
If you still have issues, check the logs using:
Copy
tail -n 50 /var/log/xrdp.log
tail -n 50 /home/luser/.xsession-errors
Let me know if you need more help or if a different desktop environment is installed!
