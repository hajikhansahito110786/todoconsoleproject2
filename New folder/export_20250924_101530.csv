Please consider using a spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, which allows you to open both files and merge their contents according to your needs. If you need assistance with a specific part of the merging process, feel free to ask!",hk123
2025-09-24T10:15:16.384670,sir link both xlsx files display boths rows and column yourself,"The first Excel file contains the following data:

| rno  | name |
|------|------|
| 1111 | abc  |
| 222  | cde  |
| 333  | df   |
| 555  | jhj  |

The second Excel file contains:

| rno  | subject |
|------|---------|
| 1111 | a1      |
| 222  | a2      |

To link these two files, you can use the `rno` column as the key to merge the data. Here's how the merged table would look:

| rno  | name | subject |
|------|------|---------|
| 1111 | abc  | a1      |
| 222  | cde  | a2      |
| 333  | df   |         |
| 555  | jhj  |         |

Rows with `rno` 333 and 555 from the first file do not have corresponding matches in the second file. If you use a full outer join method, these rows will still appear in your merged dataset【13:0†source】【13:2†source】.",hk123
