Title: Cricket’s Most Epic Moments (For Beginners)

[Cold open]
(SFX: crowd roar, heartbeat)
On-screen text: “Cricket’s Most Epic Moments… in 5 minutes!”
Host: If you think cricket is slow, wait till you see this. Last-ball sixes, Super Overs, and heroes under pressure. Let’s dive into the craziest cricket moments, explained in simple English, so anyone can enjoy. Stick around for the final clip—it still gives me goosebumps.

[Intro]
Host on camera: Hey everyone, I’m [Your Name]. If you’re new to cricket, here’s the fastest crash course:

Two teams. One bats, one bowls.
The batting team tries to score runs. The bowling team tries to get 10 players out—these are “wickets.”
Formats: Test (up to 5 days), One-Day (50 overs each), and T20 (20 overs each). More overs = longer game. That’s it! Now, the jaw-dropping moments.
The 2019 World Cup Final: England vs New Zealand
(Clips: diving stops, ball hitting stumps, players in shock)
Host: Imagine a final that ties twice. England and New Zealand ended the match tied, then played a “Super Over”—also tied. England won on a tiny rule about boundaries hit. The commentator shouted, “By the barest of margins!” It was drama, pressure, tears—everything sport can be.

Six Sixes in One Over: Yuvraj Singh, 2007
(Clips: six after six, scoreboard spinning)
Host: In the first T20 World Cup, India’s Yuvraj Singh hit 6 balls for 6 sixes in one over. That’s maximum every ball. Boom, boom, boom—six times! India went on to win the tournament, and T20 cricket exploded in popularity.

The 2005 Ashes: The Series That Hooked a Generation
(Clips: Flintoff consoling Brett Lee, tight finishes)
Host: England vs Australia, pure drama. At Edgbaston, England won by just 2 runs. Only 2! One small edge and the whole series shifts. The sportsmanship, the nerves, the noise—this series made millions fall in love with cricket.

India’s 1983 World Cup Shock
(Clips: Kapil Dev’s running catch, celebrations at Lord’s)
Host: West Indies were unbeatable. India were underdogs. Then Kapil Dev took a stunning catch to dismiss Viv Richards, and India won the World Cup. This moment changed cricket in India forever.

The Greatest ODI Chase: SA vs Australia, 2006
(Clips: scoreboard 434, crowd dancing)
Host: Australia smashed 434 runs—back then, a mountain. South Africa said, “Watch us,” and chased 438. Herschelle Gibbs hit 175. World record. Absolute madness. If you like big hits and fast scores, this is your match.

The Ball of the Century: Shane Warne, 1993
(Clips: ball drifting and turning, batter stunned)
Host: Spin bowling looks like magic when done right. Shane Warne bowled one delivery that drifted one way, then turned sharply the other way to hit the stumps. The batter looked back like, “What just happened?” People still call it the Ball of the Century.

Women’s Cricket on the Big Stage: 2017 and 2020
(Clips: Lord’s packed crowd, MCG lights)
Host: In 2017 at Lord’s, England beat India in a tense final, and Anya Shrubsole took 6 wickets. It felt like a turning point. Then in 2020, a record crowd filled the MCG for a women’s T20 final. Huge stage, huge talent. Women’s cricket is booming—and it’s awesome to watch.

“Remember the Name!” Carlos Brathwaite, 2016
(Clips: four sixes, commentators shouting)
Host: West Indies needed 19 runs off the last over to win the T20 World Cup. Carlos Brathwaite hit four sixes in a row. The commentator screamed, “Remember the name!” It’s the perfect clip to show a cricket newbie what pressure looks like.

Headingley Heroics: Ben Stokes, 2019
(Clips: Stokes sweeping, Jack Leach cleaning glasses, wild crowd)
Host: England needed an impossible chase against Australia. One wicket left. Ben Stokes kept hitting, blocking, surviving. He finished 135 not out and won it. Pure grit. Pure belief. You couldn’t write it better.

[Quick Hits – lightning round]

Sachin Tendulkar: first to score 200 in a One-Day International.
Rohit Sharma: the highest ODI score—264 runs. Yes, one player.
Kevin O’Brien: fastest World Cup hundred (2011) as Ireland shocked England.
[Why people love this game]
Host: Cricket has slow-build tension and then sudden explosions—like a movie that ends with a shootout. It’s skill, strategy, mind games, and heart. And once you understand a few basics, the drama hits even harder.

[Call to action]
Host on camera: Which moment hooked you? Drop your favorite in the comments. Want a Part 2 with crazy upsets, sledging stories, and unforgettable catches? Hit like, subscribe, and turn on the bell. I’ll also post a beginner’s guide to rules and terms in the next video—don’t miss it!

[Outro]

Host: Thanks for watching. See you in the next innings!
Excellent! You've got "Code A" - the script. This is a fantastic start. The script is well-structured, engaging, and perfect for a faceless channel. Now, let's execute "Code B": turning that text into a real video using your "lazy, poor, AI-powered" method.

Here is your step-by-step action plan:

Step 1: Generate the Voiceover (AI English)
Go to ElevenLabs.io.

Create a free account (you get 10,000 characters per month).

Copy and paste your entire script into the text box.

Choose a Voice: Experiment with the different pre-made voices. For this sports-centric script, a "Narrator" or "Confident" voice like "Rachel" or "Adam" would work well.

Generate: Click "Generate." Listen to a preview. If you don't like it, adjust the "Stability" and "Clarity" sliders slightly and try again.

Download: Once you're happy, download the MP3 file. Name it cricket_epic_moments_vo.mp3.

Pro Tip: You might need to generate the voiceover in 2-3 parts to stay within the free character limit. Just split your script logically (e.g., Intro to Moment 3, Moments 4-6, etc.).

Step 2: Gather Visuals (Stock Footage & AI Images)
Since you can't use copyrighted cricket footage, here's your workaround:

Go to Pexels.com or Pixabay.com (both 100% free).

Search for these terms:

cricket stadium crowd

cricket silhouette

celebrating team

trophy celebration

australia landscape (for Ashes)

india celebration

south africa landscape

women sports celebration

close up of stressed person (for pressure moments)

Download 10-15 of the best, highest-quality clips and images. You'll use these as B-roll.

For Specific Moments (AI Images):

Go to Leonardo.ai (create a free account).

Use prompts to generate generic images that represent the moments:

Prompt for "Super Over": "dramatic cricket match final moment, two batsmen running, digital art"

Prompt for "Six Sixes": "cricket bat hitting ball, explosive energy, night sky, abstract"

Prompt for "Ball of Century": "cricket ball magically spinning in mid air, trail of light, concept art"

Step 3: Assemble the Video in CapCut (Free & Easy)
This is where the magic happens.

Create a New Project: Open CapCut (on phone or desktop) and start a new project.

Import Media: Import your cricket_epic_moments_vo.mp3 and all the stock footage/AI images you downloaded.

The "Lazy" Workflow:

Drag your voiceover MP3 to the timeline first. This is your backbone.

Now, watch the timeline and listen to your script. As the voiceover talks about each moment, drag the corresponding stock footage or AI image onto the video track above the audio.

Keep it dynamic: Change the clip every 3-5 seconds to match the pace of the narration. Use CapCut's "Auto-Beats" feature if available to snap clips to the rhythm.

Add Automatic Subtitles (This is Crucial):

In CapCut, find the "Text" menu and select "Auto Captions."

Select your voiceover track and let CapCut generate the subtitles.

Edit them for accuracy. Fix any mistakes the AI made.

Choose a clear, bold font (like "Bebas Neue" or "Impact") and make sure the text has a slight background shadow so it's always readable.

Add Background Music:

In CapCut, go to "Audio" > "Trending" or "YouTube Library."

Choose an "Epic Inspirational" or "Upbeat Cinematic" track.

Drag it to the timeline. CRUCIAL: Use the "Audio Mix" feature to lower the volume of the music so it's clearly in the background and doesn't overpower your voiceover.

Add Simple Graphics:

When the host says "Let's dive into the craziest cricket moments," use CapCut's "Text" feature to put a title on screen: "Cricket's Most Epic Moments".

When introducing each moment (e.g., "The 2019 World Cup Final"), put a lower-third title on screen with the event name.

Step 4: Create the Thumbnail in Canva (Free)
Go to Canva.com and create a free account.

Search for "YouTube Thumbnail" and choose a template.

Your Thumbnail Recipe:

Background: Use one of your most dramatic AI-generated cricket images or a high-contrast stock photo of a celebrating player (silhouette works great).

Large Text: "Cricket's MOST EPIC Moments"

Smaller Text: "Beginners Guide"

Use a bright color (like red or yellow) for the text to make it pop.

Add an element like a glowing cricket ball or a "SHOCKED" emoji face.

Step 5: Upload and Optimize on YouTube
Title: Use the one from your script: "Cricket’s Most Epic Moments (For Beginners)"

Scene 1 – Bubbleville Morning
“3D cartoon style, bright pastel color palette. A cheerful turtle named Toby wearing a tiny green cap stands in the sunny village square of Bubbleville, surrounded by round, bubble-shaped pastel houses. Two rabbit friends giggle and point at him, while a friendly bird perches on a lamppost. The mood is lighthearted and playful.”

Scene 2 – Toby’s Practice Hill
“3D cartoon style, vibrant but slightly softer tones. Toby climbs a grassy hill dotted with colorful flowers and smooth rocks. He carries a small backpack and wipes sweat from his brow. In the distance, his rabbit friends peek from behind a bush, whispering and exchanging doubtful glances. The scene feels determined yet a bit tense.”

Scene 3 – The Great Bubbleville Race
“3D cartoon style, dynamic and colorful. A lively racetrack with cheering 3D-cartoon animals—rabbits, squirrels, hedgehogs—all poised at the start line. Toby stands among them, his eyes focused ahead. Colorful balloons and pennants flutter overhead, and a big ‘GO!’ banner hangs above. The energy is exciting and hopeful.”

Scene 4 – Celebration at the Finish Line
“3D cartoon style, bright and triumphant. Toby crosses the striped finish line on a cobblestone path, smiling widely. His rabbit and bird friends rush forward to hug him. Confetti rains down in pastel colors, and the Bubbleville townsfolk cheer. The mood is joyful and proud, highlighting Toby’s perseverance.”
