I have successfully completed all the requested tasks for enhancing the student management system with AI chatbot and audit trail functionality. Here's
  a summary of the work completed:

  Completed Enhancements:

   1. Context-Aware AI Chatbot:
      - Enhanced the chatbot to provide database context (student and todo counts)
      - Improved responses with real-time statistics from the database
      - Maintained compatibility with multiple AI services (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)

   2. Comprehensive Audit Trail System:
      - Added AuditLog model to track all user actions
      - Implemented logging for login/logout events
      - Added audit logging for todo creation and updates
      - Added audit logging for student creation and updates
      - Captures IP addresses and user agents for security tracking
      - Created endpoint to retrieve audit logs

   3. Windows Compatibility Fixes:
      - Removed all emoji characters that caused encoding issues on Windows
      - Ensured proper handling of Unicode characters

   4. Database Compatibility:
      - Updated all database schemas to work with SQLite
      - Fixed PostgreSQL-specific syntax for broader compatibility

  The application is now a fully functional student management system with AI assistance and comprehensive audit capabilities. The system tracks all
  user actions, provides contextual help through the AI chatbot, and maintains detailed logs for compliance and security purposes.

  All functionality has been implemented and tested, creating a robust, auditable system that meets the requirements specified.
