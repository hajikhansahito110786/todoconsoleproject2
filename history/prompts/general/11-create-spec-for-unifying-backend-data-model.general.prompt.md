## Prompt

sure

## Response snapshot

Okay, I will start by creating the `spec.md` file to formally define the goal of unifying the backend data model.

First, I need to read the `spec-template.md` file.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a detailed `spec.md` outlining the requirements for unifying the backend data models.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run for this planning stage.
- 📁 Files: Created `specs/unify-backend-data-model/spec.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue with plan.md and tasks.md creation.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully guided the user through the initial planning stage of SpecKit Plus for a critical refactoring task.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
