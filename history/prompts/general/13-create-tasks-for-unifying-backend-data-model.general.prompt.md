## Prompt

[Implicit: After plan.md creation, proceeded with tasks.md]

## Response snapshot

I have the `tasks-template.md`. Now I will populate it with the specific tasks for 'Unify Backend Data Model' and create the file `specs/unify-backend-data-model/tasks.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a detailed `tasks.md` outlining the step-by-step implementation plan for unifying the backend data models.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run for this planning stage.
- 📁 Files: Created `specs/unify-backend-data-model/tasks.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to start implementation based on the tasks.
- 🧠 Reflection: The tasks are structured to follow TDD, ensuring tests are written before implementation.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): n/a
