## Prompt

[Implicit: After user approved the plan to create spec, plan, and tasks files, I proceeded with plan.md]

## Response snapshot

I have the `plan-template.md`. Now I will populate it with the architectural plan for 'Unify Backend Data Model' and create the file `specs/unify-backend-data-model/plan.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a detailed `plan.md` outlining the architectural strategy for unifying the backend data models.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run for this planning stage.
- 📁 Files: Created `specs/unify-backend-data-model/plan.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue with tasks.md creation.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully created the plan document, detailing the technical approach for the refactoring.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): n/a
